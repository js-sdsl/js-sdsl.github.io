Js-sdsl uses `jest` to write unit tests and synchronize to [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/js-sdsl/js-sdsl).

We have conducted strict unit tests on each function of each container, and all Pull Requests require a coverage rate of more than **95%**.

The code for the unit test can be found [here](https://github.com/js-sdsl/js-sdsl/tree/main/test).
