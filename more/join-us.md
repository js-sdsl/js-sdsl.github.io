The current documentation is written using the [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) framework.

If you want, feel free to fork [this repository](https://github.com/js-sdsl/js-sdsl.github.io) and start translating, as long as you make progress, please open an issue or pull request in the main repository, we will call on more contributors to help.
